# Exception-and-errors-handling-in-Java-/*

Exception handling and Errors:

- There are 3 types of errors:  Syntax, logical and runtime errors.

- syntax and logical errors are encountered by the programmer whereas runtime errors are encountered by the

user.

- Exception is an event that occurs when the program is executed disrupting the normal flow of instructions.

They are mainly of 2 types:

1. Checked exception: compile time exception.

2. Unchecked exception: runtime exception.

* The throws keyword:

- It is used to declare an exception, gives information to the programmer that there might be an exception. It is better

 to be prepared with try catch block.

* Finally block:

- Finally block contains the code which is always executed whether the exception is handled or not.

- It is used to execute the code containing instructions to release the system resources, close a connection...
